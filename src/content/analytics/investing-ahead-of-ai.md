## Beyond the Model Builders

As the initial frenzy around Large Language Models (LLMs) settles into a mature industrial phase, the "easy money" in direct AI application developers has likely been made. The next frontier for the quantitative investor lies in the **physical constraints** of compute.

### The Energy Bottleneck

Training a frontier model in 2025 requires gigawatts of power. Data centers are competing with cities for grid access.

- **Nuclear Micro-reactors**: We are seeing a surge in valuation for modular nuclear solutions.
- **Grid Modernization**: Copper and high-voltage transmission equipment manufacturers are the silent winners of the AI boom.

### Specialized Compute

While general-purpose GPUs started the revolution, inference-specialized ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are scaling it.

> "During a gold rush, sell shovels. During an AI revolution, sell cooling systems and transmission lines."

**Outlook**: We remain overweight on utilities with heavy renewable exposure and semiconductor fabrication equipment, while reducing exposure to pure-play software wrappers.
