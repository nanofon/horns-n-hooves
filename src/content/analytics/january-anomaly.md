### What is it?

Historically, small-cap stocks have tended to outperform large-cap stocks in January. This phenomenon is often attributed to **tax-loss harvesting** in December.

1.  **December Selling**: Investors sell losing positions in December to offset capital gains tax liabilities. This selling pressure depresses the prices of these stocks, often pushing them below their fundamental value.
2.  **January Buying**: Once the new tax year begins in January, investors rush back into the market to repurchase these discounted assets. This surge in demand drives prices up, creating a temporary period of outperformance.

### Implications for Investors

While market efficiency has eroded some of this edge over recent decades as algorithms anticipate the move, the structural drivers—taxes and portfolio rebalancing—remain real.

- **Liquidity considerations**: The effect is often more pronounced in less liquid markets.
- **Sector rotation**: It typically coincides with a rotation back into riskier assets after year-end "window dressing" by institutional managers.

> **Note**: Past performance is not indicative of future results. However, being aware of these seasonal flows is crucial for effective trade execution and risk management during the winter months.
