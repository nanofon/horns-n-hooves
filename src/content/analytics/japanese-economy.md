### Corporate Governance Reform

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's mandate for companies trading below book value to "fix it or delist" has unleashed a wave of:

1.  **Share Buybacks**: Returning cash to shareholders.
2.  **Unwinding Cross-Shareholdings**: Breaking up the _keiretsu_ webs that stifled innovation.

### The Demographic Dividend?

- **Automation Leaders**: Japan's robotics sector is uniquely positioned to solve not just local, but global labor shortages.

**Thesis**: We view Japan not as a value trap, but as a restructuring play. We are long banking sectors that benefit from positive interest rate spreads for the first time in decades.
