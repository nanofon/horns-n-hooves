### The Resource Case: Energy and Materials

1.  **The Moon**: The primary target is **Helium-3**, a non-radioactive isotope rare on Earth but abundant in lunar regolith, potentially fueling future fusion reactors. Additionally, Rare Earth Elements (REEs) crucial for electronics are readily available without the ecological cost of terrestrial mining.
2.  **Mars**: The Red Planet offers abundant **iron, titanium, and nickel**. More importantly, its subsurface water ice is the key to synthesizing rocket fuel (hydrogen and oxygen), turning Mars into the logistics hub of the solar system.

### The Scientific Case: Mining for History

The search for "fossils"—or ancient microbial biosignatures—on Mars is the scientific counterpart to resource extraction.

- **Dual-Use Tech**: The same autonomous drills and mass spectrometers developed to hunt for ancient Martian life are being adapted by mining companies to assay ore grades.
- **The "Paleo-Economy"**: Discovering evidence of past life would spark a "Gold Rush" of scientific investment, subsidizing the heavy infrastructure (transport, power, habs) that commercial miners need to become profitable.

### Investment Outlook

Direct investment in "space mining" remains highly speculative. However, the **"pick and shovel"** plays are maturing:

- **Robotics & Automation**: Companies building autonomous rovers for NASA are pivoting to commercial surveying.
- **Launch Providers**: Lower launch costs (via SpaceX, Blue Origin) are the single biggest enabler of this sector.

> **Conclusion**: While we are unlikely to find dinosaur bones on the Moon, the hunt for resources—and the secrets of life's origins—provides a diversified, long-term opportunity for the patient capital allocator.
